  ## WHO ARE WE?
#subtitle
  [CARTERA DE INVERSIONES C.M. S.A, FAMILY OFFICE]{.who-are-we__subtitle}
#float
  A holding company founded in 1988 by Joaquín Molins to bring together and organize the management of the family’s assets.
#text
  From the very beginning and to the present day, our management has been based on wealth planning, evolving towards an investment strategy and asset distribution in three major areas: investment in financial assets (capital markets), investments in startups as well as business acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, real estate investments. Our basic strategy leads us to a management model, essentially seeking to achieve a reasonable return with a limited level of risk. The main objective of our management model is the preservation of the assets, and primarily the family business, and its development through the next generations. Together with our team, collaborators, and the support of the Molins family, we are fully convinced that through effort, dedication, and enthusiasm, we will achieve the proposed objectives.
