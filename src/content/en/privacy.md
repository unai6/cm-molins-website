# PRIVACY POLICY

## INTRODUCTION
Your privacy is important to us, so through this document, we will explain what data we collect from our users, how we use it, and why, among other guidelines. Those over the age of 14 may register themselves as users without the previous consent of their parents, guardians, or legal representatives. In the case of children under the age of 14 or identified as “legally incompetent,” we will always need the consent of their parent, guardian, or legal representative.

For your information, we will never ask for more details than we will actually need for the services required; we will never share it with third parties, except by legal obligation or with your previous authorisation; and we will never use your data for any purpose not previously specified.

As users, you should read this Privacy Policy carefully, on a regular basis, and every time you enter your personal data because this document may have been modified. The provider can change any type of information that may appear on the website to comply with regulations or to update the policy without the obligation to give prior notice or inform users of said obligations, with publication on the website of the provider being sufficient.

## DATA CONTROLLER
**CARTERA DE INVERSIONES CM, S.A.** as the owner of the website, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 (GDPR) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and other existing regulations on the protection of personal data and by Law 34/2002, of 11 July, on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (LSSICE), informs you that it has implemented the necessary security measures, both technical and organisational, to ensure and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data entered.

## THE PURPOSE OF DATA PROCESSING
Your personal data will only be used for the purposes, after providing your consent, in the corresponding document of the provider:
- To carry out the services that user contract us and the commercial, administrative, fiscal, and accounting procedures that are required under current legislation;
- To know your opinion and improve the services provided by the provider;
- The photographs that are posted on the website are the property of **CARTERA DE INVERSIONES CM, S.A.**

You can withdraw your consent at any time by sending a letter with the subject “Unsubscribe” to the aforementioned email.

According to the LSSICE, **CARTERA DE INVERSIONES CM, S.A.** does not engage in spamming and, therefore, does not send commercial emails that have not been previously requested or authorised by the user. Accordingly, in all the communications you will receive from the provider, the user has the possibility to withdraw their express consent to receive our communications.

We will not process your personal data for any purpose other than those described except for legal obligation or judicial requirement.

You will not be the subject of decisions based on automated processing that will have an effect on your data.

## THE LEGITIMACY OF DATA PROCESSING
The legal basis for the processing of your data is the consent you grant at the time of entering your data in the corresponding form to accomplish the purposes, at the moment of ticking the checkbox.

Failure to provide the requested personal data or not accepting this Privacy Policy implies the impossibility of achieving the purposes described above.

In cases where there is a prior contractual relationship between the parties, the legal basis for the development of the administrative, fiscal, accounting and labour obligations that are necessary under the current legislation will be the previous existence of a commercial relationship between the parties.

The prospective or commercial offering of products and services is based on the consent that is requested from you and under no circumstances does the withdrawal of this consent have any bearing on the execution of the subscription agreement.

## DATA RETENTION PERIOD
Your data will be retained for the duration of your commercial relationship with us or until you exercise your right to the cancellation, withdrawal, or limitation of processing. However, we will retain your data for the time required by law in accordance with the applicable provisions.

## RECIPIENTS OF DISCLOSURES AND TRANSFERS
**CARTERA DE INVERSIONES CM, S.A.** does not perform any transfers or disclosures of data either inside or outside the EU. The provider will only provide information to law enforcement agencies under a court order or legal obligation, without prejudice to the ability to block or cancel your account if there are any indications that the user has committed any crime. The information provided will only be available to the provider at that time. The information that you provide us through this website will be hosted on the **CARTERA DE INVERSIONES CM, S.A.** servers, contracted from the company that provides the web hosting service. The processing of the data of the entity is regulated by a data processor contract between the provider and this company.

As a user, you have the right to withdraw the consent given at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the legality of the processing performed prior to your consent being revoked.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority if you believe that your rights in relation to the protection of your data may have been infringed (aepd.es).

## SECURITY MEASURES
The data you provide to us will be treated confidentially. The provider has adopted all the technical and organisational measures and all the levels of protection necessary to ensure the secure processing of data and to prevent its alteration, loss, theft, and unauthorised processing or access, in line with the current state of technology and the nature of the data stored. Likewise, it guarantees that the processing and registration in files, programs, systems, equipment, premises, and centres comply with the requirements and conditions of integrity and security established in the current regulations.

## LANGUAGE

## CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
